# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my work in analyzing data related to electric vehicles, exploring trends, and deriving meaningful insights. The analysis covers various aspects, including sales patterns, geographic distribution, and factors influencing electric vehicle adoption.

## Project Overview

- **Data Sources:** The analysis is based on publicly available datasets from sources such as Kaggle, government databases, and industry reports.

- **Key Focus Areas:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Statistical Analysis
  - SQL, Power Bi
  - Data Visualization

## Folder Structure

- data: Folder containing the datasets used in the analysis(ElectricCarData_Clean.csv).
- visualizations: Visualizations and graphs generated during the analysis on power Bi (Electric_Vechicle_data.pbix).

## How to Use

1. **View Visualizations:** Navigate to the `/visualizations` folder to see graphical representations of the data insights.

2. **Reproduce Analysis:** Clone the repository and run the notebooks to reproduce the analysis. Make sure to check the data sources and update paths if needed.

## Highlights

- **EDA Visualizations:** Interactive charts depicting trends in electric vehicle sales, geographic distribution, and more.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing results and regression analyses.

## Challenges and Learnings
